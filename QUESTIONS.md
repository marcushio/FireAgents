"Configuration File Format
 Base station info starts with “station” and is followed two numbers representing the x
and y coordinates of the node the station is on. This should be the location of a node
specified somewhere in the file. Our simulation assumes there will be only one base
station, so you may decide how to handle extra station lines."

Choose and document!

Does this mean our testers will have config files that specify
more than one station?  

Can we assume the config file specifieds a CONNECTED graph?

    Yes but document it.


 How do we indicate concurrency in diagram?
