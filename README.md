# Fire Monitor Simulation

Colton Trujillo & Marcus Trujillo

### Introduction

This project simulates a network of sensors that use agents to communicate with a central base station to log
the behavior of forest fires.

### Usage

Run the program from the command-line, feeding in an argument with the complete path to the configuration file
you will use.

### Project Assumptions

List any assumptions outside of one's specified in project writeup.

### Design Choice
For parsing the configuration file, we decided to...

Explain any special algorithm, data structure, or logic used that was crucial to
solving the problem. Also explain any design choice you feel is important.

### Versions

All version submitted and their features.

### Docs

The design document is in the doc folder.

### Known Issues
Does not have Coordinate class
Does not extract data from config file strings into any structures.
Does not handle redundant station specs coming in from the config file

### Testing and Debugging

Include any testing and debugging procedures you performed, if any.
